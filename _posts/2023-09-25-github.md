## GitHub via SSH

- useful links: [nerderati.com](https://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/)
- [stackoverflow](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20706/what-is-the-difference-between-authorized-keys-and-known-hosts-file-for-ssh), [stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/42643/ssh-key-based-authentication-known-hosts-vs-authorized-keys)
- connect to GitHub without username and personal access token
- don't have to fiddle with credential manager
- but may not work with firewalls and proxy servers

Notes:

- the email in `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "john@doe.example.com"` is just a comment, to identify who created the key -> helps figure out what to delete when you have many keys in an authorized_keys file and you need to revoke or change one of them; you can write e.g. `username@servername` or `YYYYMMDD_surname_givenname`
- save key passphrase in password manager
- if you specify `github-doe-company` as a "Host" in the `~/.ssh/config` file, you can change the remote to `git remote set-url origin git@github-doe-company:username/repo.git`
- you can even add port forwarding to `~/.ssh/config`, automatically pass local environment variables and more

## Set up multiple accounts (work and personal)
