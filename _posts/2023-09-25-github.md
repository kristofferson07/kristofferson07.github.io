## GitHub via SSH

- useful links: [nerderati.com](https://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/)
- connect to GitHub without username and personal access token, don't have to fiddle with credential manager
- but may not work with firewalls and proxy servers

Notes:

- if you specify `github-doe-company` as a "Host" in the `~/.ssh/config` file, you can change the remote to `git remote set-url origin git@github-doe-company:username/repo.git`

## Set up multiple accounts (work and personal)

- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3860112/multiple-github-accounts-on-the-same-computer)
- [code.tutsplus.com](https://code.tutsplus.com/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574t)
- don't forget to set username and email on a repository or directory basis (e.g. `[includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"]`)
