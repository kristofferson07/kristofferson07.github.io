## General

- [stackoverflow](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20706/what-is-the-difference-between-authorized-keys-and-known-hosts-file-for-ssh), [stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/42643/ssh-key-based-authentication-known-hosts-vs-authorized-keys)

## Create key

- the file name should probably reflect the intended usage, e.g. `id_rsa_GITHUB`
- the email in `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "john@doe.example.com"` is just a comment, to identify who created the key -> helps figure out what to delete when you have many keys in an authorized_keys file and you need to revoke or change one of them; you can write e.g. `username@servername` or `YYYYMMDD_surname_givenname`
- save key passphrase in password manager

## Config file

- you can even add port forwarding to `~/.ssh/config`, automatically pass local environment variables and more
